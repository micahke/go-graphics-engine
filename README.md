# Go Graphics Engine

This is a demo graphics engine built using Go. I'm following the tutorials on [LearnOpenGL](https://www.learnopengl.com). To get the demo running, make sure you have [Go](https://www.go.dev/dl) installed on your machine. In the project directory run:

```bash
go mod tidy # install dependencies
go run .    # run the application
```

To build and run as an executable:

```bash
go mod tidy # install dependencies
go build    # build
./go-graphics-engine  # run the executable
```
